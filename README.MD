# Sorcerer-Script

## Info
Made this bad boy back in 2021 to meme around with it; it has seen it's play and it's finally time to archive it as it's no longer viable.
This script is being posted exclusively for educational purposes and will not get any updates ( unless u make a pull request, I'll approve it )
Credits to the guy who did tracking of party state back in time for auto-heal etc, forgot their name :(

Majority of the features of this script are tracked by "MT:The Dream"'s GM team so I advise you to not use it

A lot of the features are implemented poorly, do not follow these practices
A lot of the features are ommited due to their nature

I think the script is compatible with NGSP/PR/Bern, idr tho, sorry

Ping tracking is weird, don't trust it

Last update : 1st of February 2022

Enjoy open source :)
